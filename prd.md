### 1. Understanding the Goal

The primary objective is to develop a lightweight web application, hosted on a Raspberry Pi, that calculates the kilowatt-hours (kWh) needed to charge an electric vehicle to 80% of its battery capacity. The application should allow users to configure the battery capacity, add multiple car profiles, and save the calculation results to a `battery.json` file.

### 2. Investigation & Analysis

Given that this is a new project with no existing codebase, the investigation phase will focus on defining the project's technical foundation and clarifying requirements.

*   **Initial State Assessment:** The project directory is currently empty except for `.gitignore` and `readme.md`. This means we are starting from a clean slate with no existing code, dependencies, or configurations to consider.

*   **Critical Questions to Answer:**
    1.  **Technology Stack:** What is the most suitable technology stack for a lightweight web application on a Raspberry Pi? A Python-based backend (like Flask or FastAPI) is a strong candidate due to its small footprint and ease of use. For the frontend, plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be sufficient and efficient.
    2.  **User Input:** What specific inputs are required from the user to perform the calculation? The prompt mentions a configurable battery capacity, but we also need the car's *current* state of charge.
    3.  **Car Profile Management:** How should the application handle adding and selecting cars? Will the car profiles be stored on the server? If so, in what format and file? A separate `cars.json` file could be a simple solution.
    4.  **User Interface (UI) Design:** What should the user interface look like? A simple, single-page application with a form for input and a section to display the result would be a good starting point.

### 3. Proposed Strategic Approach

The development process can be broken down into three main phases:

*   **Phase 1: Backend API Development**
    1.  **Setup:** Initialize a Python project and install a lightweight web framework like Flask.
    2.  **Calculation Logic:** Implement the core function to calculate the kWh needed to charge to 80%. This function will take the total battery capacity and the current charge percentage as inputs.
    3.  **API Endpoints:**
        *   Create a `POST` endpoint (e.g., `/calculate`) that receives the car data (total capacity and current charge) and returns the calculated kWh.
        *   Upon successful calculation, the backend will write the result to `battery.json` in the format `{"kwh_needed": 23.50}`.
        *   Create endpoints for managing car profiles (e.g., `GET /cars`, `POST /cars`) that will read from and write to a `cars.json` file.
    4.  **Data Storage:**
        *   `battery.json`: Stores the result of the last calculation.
        *   `cars.json`: Stores a list of car profiles, each with a name and battery capacity.

*   **Phase 2: Frontend Development**
    1.  **HTML Structure:** Create an `index.html` file with a simple structure:
        *   A form with inputs for the current charge percentage.
        *   A dropdown menu to select a car profile (populated from the backend).
        *   A button to trigger the calculation.
        *   An area to display the result.
        *   A separate form for adding a new car profile (name and battery capacity).
    2.  **JavaScript Logic:**
        *   On page load, fetch the list of cars from the backend (`GET /cars`) and populate the dropdown.
        *   When the "calculate" button is clicked, send the selected car's data and the current charge percentage to the backend (`POST /calculate`).
        *   Display the returned result on the page.
        *   Implement the logic for the "add car" form to send the new car data to the backend (`POST /cars`).

*   **Phase 3: Deployment on Raspberry Pi**
    1.  **Environment Setup:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing the Python dependencies (e.g., `Flask`).
    2.  **Deployment Guide:** Write a simple `readme.md` with instructions on how to:
        *   Install the necessary dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
        *   Run the web server (`python app.py`).
        *   Access the web application from a browser on the same network.

### 4. Verification Strategy

To ensure the application is working correctly, the following testing strategies should be employed:

*   **Backend (API) Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Write tests for the calculation logic to verify its correctness with various inputs.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test the API endpoints to ensure they correctly handle requests, update the `.json` files, and return the expected responses. Test edge cases like invalid input data.
*   **Frontend (UI) Testing:**
    *   **Manual Testing:** Manually test the web interface in a browser to ensure that:
        *   Car profiles are loaded and displayed correctly.
        *   The calculation is triggered correctly and the result is displayed.
        *   New cars can be added successfully.
*   **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   Perform a full workflow test on the Raspberry Pi itself to confirm that the entire system works as expected in the target environment.

### 5. Anticipated Challenges & Considerations

*   **Raspberry Pi Performance:** The choice of a lightweight technology stack (Python/Flask, plain JS) is crucial to ensure smooth performance on the Raspberry Pi.
*   **Data Persistence and Concurrency:** The application will be writing to JSON files. While simple, this approach is not robust against concurrent requests. For this small-scale application, it's likely an acceptable trade-off, but it's a limitation to be aware of.
*   **User Experience:** The initial plan is for a minimal UI. Depending on user feedback, further enhancements might be needed to improve usability.
*   **Security:** The application will be hosted on a local network, which limits exposure. However, it's good practice to be mindful of basic web security principles, such as validating and sanitizing user input.
*   **Error Handling:** The plan should include robust error handling on both the backend (e.g., for file I/O errors) and frontend (e.g., for failed API requests) to provide a better user experience.
